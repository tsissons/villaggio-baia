						<h2>Ciao e Benvenuto!</h2>
						<p>Lamezia is the region of Calabria where "Calabrese" comes from, is renowned for Gelato, and is where you can still capture a glimpse of true Italian Mediterranean lifestyle. Located between a five-star hotel and a Club Med, there is certainly recognized holiday interest in the area, and yet it still manages to maintain its charm, seclusion, and peace.<br>  <br>Our two suites are in <em>Villaggio Baia</em>, a charming three-storey apartment building located less than 150m from an <strong>expansive tree-lined sandy beach.</strong> The beach is nearly private for most of the year, save the bustling Italian holiday month of August, when barbeques, bacci ball, and roccous family fun is abound. Within the grounds, there is a small swimming pool, a tarmac football pitch, and within the neighbourhood, there is also a grass football pitch, and equestrian activities. There is also lift access in the building. The suites are self-catering, and include a fully equiped kitchen, convertible sofa bed, a king sized bed., so you can feel completely at home here in beautiful Lamezia.</p>
